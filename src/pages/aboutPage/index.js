                    The CCDI Childhood Cancer Data Catalog is an inventory of pediatric oncology data resources, including childhood cancer repositories, registries,
                    data commons, web sites, and catalogs that either manage or refer to data. The data catalog is intended to help researchers learn about existing
                    pediatric data resources to develop new biomedical hypothesis or analyze the data for clinical or therapeutic efficacy. While the data catalog does
                    not provide access to the data, it provides summary information that will allow researchers to select the resource(s) relevant to their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each data resource summary includes an overview by disease type, number of samples analyzed, availability of molecular and imaging data,
                    and characteristics of the samples studied (e.g. age, phenotype). After reviewing the data resource summaries, researchers can use the provided link
                    or contact details to learn how to gain access to the data.
